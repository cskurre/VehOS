# VehOS

Pronounced "Vee-ose" or "Veeh-ohs"

With all of the talk about Right To Repair and Open Source hardware and software, it's time we had a vehicle that was Open Source

This public project will be used to help develop the design of an open source vehicle, from the frame, body, electronics, all the way down to software. I understand not all purchased components will be open source, but an effort will be made to use OS ones when possible. Once the project is nearing an alpha stage I'll see about building it, most likely in stages. Enjoy, and thanks for the help!
